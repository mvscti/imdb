IMDBs are databases that do not work with physical file management, keeping all main memory data and indexes. Therefore, they are simpler and use is restricted to computer's RAM capacity, but what caused queries to be processed very fast. This project simulates an IMDB and the objective is to import an SQL file.
After compiling, the code can be executed in two ways. The first is using GUI. To do this, simply execute the command in the terminal:
java –jar IMDB.jar
Or, without GUI:
java –jar IMDB.jar “path/to/sql-file”
