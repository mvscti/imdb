IMDBs are databases that do not work with physical file management, keeping all main memory data and indexes. Therefore, they are simpler and use is restricted to computer's RAM capacity, but what caused queries to be processed very fast. This project simulates an IMDB and the objective is to import an SQL file.
After compiling, the code can be executed in two ways. The first one is using the GUI. To do this, simply execute the command in the terminal:
ˋˋˋ
java –jar IMDB.jar
ˋˋˋ
Or if you prefer, you can use the IMBD without GUI:
ˋˋˋ
java –jar IMDB.jar “path/to/sql-file”
ˋˋˋ
